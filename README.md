# Markdown Tutorial

This is a paragraph.Just write plain text and it will be rendered as a paragraph (`<p></p>` tag in HTML) <br>**Markdown** is a lightweight markup language used for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor.

**Table of Contents:**

1. [Headings](#heading-1) 
1. [Bold](#bold-and-italics-and-horizontal-line)
1. [Block Quote](#block-quote)
1. [Code](#code)
# Heading 1
The above line is a heading (h1 tag for html). We can do that using single # symbol.<br>
Similarly we have got h2,h3...h6 and we can use the # symbol the same number of times as the number that follows the h tag that you want to use.So for heading 2 or h2 you use # symbol twice (##)
> ðŸ’¡**Tip:** Always give a space between the # (or any symbol) and the text else it won't be rendered in the intended way

## Bold and Italics and Horizontal Line
---
- Place text between two asterisks two make it bold (** <_text_>**) but don't leave spaces between the asterisks and the text in this case. Space has been given in the example to demonstrate.
- For italics use two underscores or single asterisks on both sides of the text
- For horizontal line use three hyphens without spaces "---" 

## Block Quote
Use the greater than symbol (>) at the beginning of a sentence to create a block quote and don't forget to give a space between the symbol and text.To *"come out"* of the block quote leave an empty line in between after the block and then continue writing

## Code
**Inline Code**

Enclose text in between backticks. `code`  <!-- `text`-->  

**Block Code**

Enclose the code block in between three backticks ( ``` ). We can also specify the language used in the code block (Eg. _js,cpp,py_ etc)
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
  cout<<"Harry Potter"<<endl;
}
```
